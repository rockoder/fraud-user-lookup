# Problem Statement

* Design and implement a user fraud check module
* See below a sample of User class as a starting point (feel free to change the class as you see fit)
* Use java or groovy
* Use gradle for building/testing module
* Any potential external services should be marked and mocked
* No persistence is necessary
* We are not providing detailed specs on purpose so that we can see your judgement calls
* We are not looking for a perfect solution, but it should look mature enough
* Timeline is no more than 1 week, but it's up to you how much time you spend (10 min, 2 hours or ... each day)
* If it takes too long, just stop and we can continue/explain the thinking during our 2nd discussion round.

```
// Sample
class User {
    String id
    String phone
    String email
}
```
